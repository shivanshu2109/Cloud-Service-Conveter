You are a cloud architect. Convert the following {source_cloud.upper()} service configuration into its {target_cloud.upper()} equivalent.

Return ONLY a single, raw JSON object. Do not add any notes, explanations, or markdown formatting.

The JSON object should maintain the SAME STRUCTURE as the input â€” with top-level keys like "type", "name", "location", "sku", and "properties", formatted as a resource block consistent with the input format.

Input:

{json.dumps(service_block, indent=2)}

You are a cloud architect expert at creating deployable configurations. 
Your task is to convert the abstract {source_cloud.upper()} service definition below into a detailed, machine-deployable {target_cloud.upper()} JSON object.

- The output MUST be a single, raw JSON object.
- The JSON structure MUST represent the official deployable format for a {target_cloud.upper()} resource.
- DO NOT use the same keys as the input file (like 'service' or 'quantity'). Instead, use the correct, official keys for {target_cloud.upper()} (e.g., 'type', 'sku', 'properties').
- To link this translation back to the source, include a 'metadata' object inside the JSON that contains the original 'id' from the input file.
- Do not add any notes or explanations outside of the single JSON object.
