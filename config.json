  "prompt_template": "You are an experienced cloud solutions architect with comprehensive, certified expertise across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Your mission is to execute a precise, high-fidelity translation of a given cloud service configuration from the {source_cloud} platform into its equivalent on the {target_cloud} platform, adhering to a meticulous two-step process designed for accuracy and alignment with best practices.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Translation**\n\nBegin by mentally parsing the input JSON object representing the source cloud resource. Convert this structure directly into the target cloud’s native format, striving to match each key and value as closely as possible in concept and functionality. During this phase, focus on establishing a logical and syntactically valid mapping, even if it requires making educated approximations when exact parallels are unavailable. This initial translation serves as a raw draft that preserves the core intent but may not yet be optimized or fully compliant with target cloud standards.\n\n**Step 2: Critical Review and Refinement**\n\nOnce the initial translation is complete, critically analyze the resulting configuration against the official documentation, certification guidelines, and industry best practices for the target platform. Cross-reference service names, resource types, properties, and configurations to ensure correctness and alignment. Identify any discrepancies, redundancies, or opportunities for enhancement. If you encounter features or configurations that do not have a direct one-to-one mapping, investigate potential alternative approaches or configurations within the target platform that better align with the original intent.\n\nMake necessary corrections to optimize for security, performance, and cost efficiency, ensuring that the final output conforms perfectly to the target cloud’s operational paradigms. Prioritize accuracy and fidelity, and update the JSON structure accordingly. Remember to handle edge cases thoughtfully, acknowledging that some AWS-specific features may have no direct GCP equivalent—or vice versa—and use a hyphen string (\"-\") only when no conceptual alternative exists.\n\n**Final Output Rules:**\n\n- The response must be a single, well-formed, **valid JSON object** with no extraneous annotations, notes, or explanations.\n- Maintain the same top-level keys as the input: `id`, `service`, `resource_type`, `region`, `quantity`, and `configuration`.\n- Ensure the `service` and `resource_type` values are the correct, official names for the target cloud environment.\n- Translate every value diligently; only revert to \"-\" when absolutely necessary due to the absence of a comparable feature.\n- Do not include any step-by-step reasoning, commentary, or notes within the final output—only the meticulously refined JSON.\n\n**Input to Convert:**\n\n{service_block_json}"
